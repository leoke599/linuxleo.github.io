    <h1>Geometry Dash</h1>
    <p>Geometry Dash is a rhythm based platformer game. It has some really difficult and awesome levels and a dedicated community which makes it great. The community kept the game alive when it didn't get any updates for 6 years</p>
    <h2>Extreme Demons</h2>
    <p>Extreme demon is the hardest difficulty in the game. It's a massive accomplishment to complete any extreme demon even if it's considered one of the easier ones</p>
    <h3>Black Blizzard</h3>
    <p>One of the most well known and popular levels in the game. It was created by KrmaL who is wdiely regarded as one of the best and most legendary creators. It is an extreme demon and I want to complete it hopefully by the end of the month.</p>
